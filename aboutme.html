		The first phase is youtube. almost everyone watches youtube now adays. everyone remembers their favourite movie or favourite song or favourite content creator. that's where i saw my first video about coding. </p> <br>

		 2.)<div class="boxmodel"> Brainstorm </div> <br>
		    <img src="https://static.skillshare.com/uploads/discussion/tmp/732b67d8"> The second phase is Brainstorm. Brainstorm is what everyone does at least once in their life time. no matter where you're from or how old you are. so thats what i did. i brainstormed and made roadmap to sucess.  </p> <br>

		 3.)<div class="boxmodel"> Action! </div> <br>
		    <img src="https://media.baamboozle.com/uploads/images/181071/1614638460_39193.jpeg"> The third and last phase is action. action is where most people give and lose their dreams and hope and desires. they fail to take acyion because of self doubt or whatever other reason but you know what they say"if you dont try you wont know". i took action by registring to the zero to mastery academy and learned the skills needed to become web developer.  </p>
